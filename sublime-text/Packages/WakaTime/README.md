## Unresponsive Plugin Warning

In Sublime Text 2, if you get a warning message:

    A plugin (WakaTime) may be making Sublime Text unresponsive by taking too long (0.017332s) in its on_modified callback.

To fix this, go to `Preferences → Settings - User` then add the following setting:

`"detect_slow_plugins": false`

## Troubleshooting

First, turn on debug mode in your `WakaTime.sublime-settings` file.

![sublime user settings](https://wakatime.com/static/img/ScreenShots/sublime-wakatime-settings-menu.png?v=3)

Add the line: `"debug": true`

Then, open your Sublime Console with `View → Show Console` ( CTRL + \` ) to see the plugin executing the wakatime cli process when sending a heartbeat.
Also, tail your `$HOME/.wakatime/wakatime.log` file to debug wakatime cli problems.
